### Running DBSCAN   
   *  ``` cd algorithms/DBSCAN/ ```
   * ``` python dbscan_segmentation.py ``` to get a baseline for instance segmentation using DB clustering
   
### Running PointGroup
   * Install requireemnts to run PointGroup as given here https://github.com/dvlab-research/PointGroup
   * ``` cd algorithms/PointGroup/Pointgroup/ ```
   * The dataset is supposed to reside in algorithms/PointGroup/Pointgroup/dataset/planteye/val you can change it in config/pointgroup_default_planteye.yaml
   * Download the pretrained models and example train and test data form https://shorturl.at/lLP29
   * ``` python test.py --resume planteye_trained_pointgroup.pth ```
   * Results are saved in Output_dir/results which can be modified via config
   * ``` python visualize_pointgroup_out.py ``` (requires open3D) by giving appropriate path of results from previous step

### Running DyCO3D
   * Install requireemnts to run PointGroup as given here https://github.com/dvlab-research/PointGroup
   * ``` cd algorithms/DYCO3D/DyCo3D/ ```
   * The dataset is supposed to reside in algorithms/DYCO3D/DyCo3D/dataset/planteye/val you can change it in config/dyco3d_besthp_planteye.yaml
   * Download the pretrained models and example train and test data form https://shorturl.at/lLP29
   * ``` python test.py --resume planteye_trained_dyco3d.pth ```
   * Results are saved in Output_dir/results which can be modified via config
   * ``` python visualize_dyco3d_out.py ``` (requires open3D) by giving appropriate path of results from previous step

## Motivation
In this work we will explore 3D pointclouds instance segmentation of plants for plant phenotyping. Plant seperation/Instance segmentation is the first step for high throughput phenotyping of plants. Traditional phenotyping requires plants to be removed/seperated manually and then perform phenotyping. This process limits the speed of phenotyping and we can accelrate phenotyping if we can seperate the plants using software. Fortunately, with recent advancements in deep learning based instance segmentation [1,3] we can perform 3D instance segmentation with high accuracy which was not possible using traiditional methods of instance semgmentation like DBSCAN or traditional graph based clustering.  Thre are two major tasks we will address in this work\
\
**1) Build a pipeline for obtaining 3D point cloud annotated dataset for instance segmentation:** \
    3D point clouds take much more time to be segmented and hence the cost of their annotation can be 10x compared to 2D images. As a result there are not many publically available datasets for point clouds like Scannet for instance segmentation. Most of the point cloud datasets are from autonomous driving domian and some from indoor point clouds domain. It is not clear how deep neural networks trained and benchmarked on these datasets will perform on out of domain datasets. In this work we annotate 232 scans by building Sagmekaer 3D point cloud annotation pipeline.

**2) Benchmark point clouds instance segmentation networks:** \
    Point clouds provide interesting challenge for instance segmentation becuase of their unstuctured, unordered and sparse nature which requires special properties from neural networks like permuation invariance, transformation invariance and point interactions. We benchamrk and evaluate different state of the art algortihhms on our point cloud dataset.

## Pipeline Summary
## Preprocess Input Point Clouds
1) First the point clouds are preprocessed to downsamaple from millions of point clouds to few hundered thousands. We use voxel size of 3 cm to downsample the pointclouds 
2) Below we have an example, on left we have original point clouds with 7.4 million points on right we have preprocessed point clouds with removed tray (based on height threshold) and downsampled point clouds resulting in 3.4 and finally 1.3 million points

2) Train the deep neural network(PointGroup, Dyco3D) and perform hyper parameter search (Bayseian based) with the preprocessed data 
    
3) Use the trained network to make inference on new data.
